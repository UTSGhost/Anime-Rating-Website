We have now come to the best and worst criteria ever. This ruined way too many Animes. It's obviously about how much I liked the ending of the Anime, not to confused with how well the ending is written (which is another category in "Objective" - "Writing" - "Ending"). If the ending is bad, then everything is. Not only will this get no score or even negative score, but then I'm totally biased against it and I'll try to ruin the scores as much as possible. The "Memory" part will also be greatly negatively affected, for very obvious reasons.</div></span></td>
